# How to download files 

-Norah recommended downloading manually onto Lacie hard drive, worked but took a long time!
-Now that all are on Lacie, tried using Cyber Duck to get them onto CHPC - did not work. do i need to be using the U's VPN?
-Tried Globus but that didn't seem to work either 
-Now trying new method going directly form web server to CHPC- this is what I was thinking originally and it worked well, a little slow

wget -r -np -nd -A "fastq,fastq.gz" \
