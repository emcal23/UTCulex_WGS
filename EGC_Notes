Step 1. How to download these files from Yale server 
  Tried manually but they were huge, def not enough space on my Mac 
emcalhoun@Ems-MacBook-Pro Desktop % df -h ~
Filesystem      Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk1s2   466Gi   124Gi   324Gi    28%    897k  3.4G    0%   /System/Volumes/Data
emcalhoun@Ems-MacBook-Pro Desktop % ls /Volumes
LaCie		Macintosh HD

emcalhoun@Ems-MacBook-Pro Desktop % df -h /Volumes/LaCie

Filesystem      Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
/dev/disk3s2   3.6Ti   286Gi   3.4Ti     8%    723k   36G    0%   /Volumes/LaCie
  
  I do have enough space on Lacie, so I think my plan for now is to ssh into CHPC get the files into our saarmangroup folder then get them onto Lacie
