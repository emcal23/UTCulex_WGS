# How to download files 

-Norah recommended downloading manually onto Lacie hard drive, worked but took a long time!
-Now that all are on Lacie, tried using Cyber Duck to get them onto CHPC - did not work. do i need to be using the U's VPN?
-Tried Globus but that didn't seem to work either 
-Now trying new method going directly form web server to CHPC- this is what I was thinking originally and it worked well, a little slow

wget -r -np -nd -A "fastq,fastq.gz" \

forgot to write about running fastqc and multiqc but it was easy added to 
/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/u1055819/saarman-group/Cx_WGS/fastQC_WGS_Cx


12/25 Conversations with Andrea and Zach about phasing and reference genomes etc. decided to use same USA Cx pipiens genome which we used for ddRAD project which exists here 
my $genome = "/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/cx_ddRAD_bwa/ref/Cpip29_nodeb_gfill_mito.fasta";

It is currently unpublished. Hopefully by the time I am ready to write they will be further along?

Been working on getting bwa-mem running for these samples. Took lots of troubleshooting.
